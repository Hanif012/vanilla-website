Hello World

## Guidelines

- **Design your website by observing the principles of human and computer interaction.** Set up your site as creative as possible but still strive for consistency.
- **The website prototype must be designed using Figma** and make sure to create some features, such as color and text style, effect, component, variant or interactive component, and navigation.
- **Consider the color, font, size, and layout** that you use to design the prototype and website.
- **Use only external CSS.** Internal or inline CSS will not be marked.
- **Use CSS box positioning to design your web structure**, do not use table for the layout.
- **Consider the language you use**, including spelling and grammar, feel free to choose either Bahasa or English, but you cannot have both at the same time.
- **Make your website responsive** so it can deliver in any size, particularly for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Any kinds of framework are prohibited.** Do the project with vanilla (original) HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Organize your files with subdirectories.**
- **Include references** (link from a website, book, etc) that you use in creating the website.
